    <p>Gold has been a symbol of value and beauty for thousands of years‚Äîbut not all gold is created equal. From 10k to 24k, the term ‚Äúkarat‚Äù refers to the purity of gold in a piece. In this guide, we‚Äôll explain what gold purity means, how it affects durability and color, and how to make the best choice for your jewelry.</p>

    <h2>What Does ‚ÄúKarat‚Äù Mean?</h2>
    <p>Karat (spelled with a "k") is the unit used to measure gold purity. Pure gold is 24 karats, meaning 24 out of 24 parts are gold‚Äî100% pure. But pure gold is soft and not ideal for everyday jewelry, so it‚Äôs often alloyed with other metals like copper, silver, or nickel for strength and color variation.</p>

    <h2>Common Gold Purity Levels</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>24k:</strong> Pure gold. Rich yellow color but very soft and prone to scratching.</li>
      <li><strong>22k:</strong> 91.6% gold. Often used in fine Indian or Middle Eastern jewelry.</li>
      <li><strong>18k:</strong> 75% gold. Warm tone, durable, and popular for luxury jewelry.</li>
      <li><strong>14k:</strong> 58.3% gold. Great balance of durability, affordability, and color. Most common for everyday wear.</li>
      <li><strong>10k:</strong> 41.7% gold. Very durable and affordable, but slightly duller in color.</li>
    </ul>

      <strong>üí° Quick Tip:</strong> The higher the karat, the purer (and softer) the gold. Lower karats are harder and more scratch-resistant.

    <h2>Types of Gold by Color</h2>
    <p>Gold color depends on what metals are used in the alloy. All these types can exist in different karats:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Yellow Gold:</strong> Classic blend of gold, copper, and silver. The most traditional look.</li>
      <li><strong>White Gold:</strong> Mixed with nickel, palladium, or silver. Often coated in rhodium for a bright white finish.</li>
      <li><strong>Rose Gold:</strong> Mixed with copper for a warm, pinkish hue. Romantic and vintage-inspired.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Gold Hallmarks & Stamps</h2>
    <p>Most gold jewelry is stamped with its karat mark (e.g. 14k, 18k) or a percentage (e.g. 750 = 75% = 18k). These stamps help identify authenticity and purity. Always check for a hallmark when buying fine gold.</p>

    <h2>Which Karat Should You Choose?</h2>
    <p>The right karat depends on your lifestyle, preferences, and budget. Here‚Äôs a quick guide:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Everyday wear:</strong> 14k or 10k for durability</li>
      <li><strong>Luxury feel:</strong> 18k for richer color and weight</li>
      <li><strong>Investment or cultural value:</strong> 22k or 24k</li>
    </ul>

      <strong>‚ú® Gemsite Tip:</strong> For engagement rings or daily-use items, 14k white or yellow gold offers the best balance of strength, color, and long-term value.

    <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
    <p>Understanding gold purity helps you make smarter choices when shopping or designing jewelry. Whether you prefer the softness of 24k, the durability of 14k, or the romantic hue of rose gold, knowing your karats ensures you're getting the right mix of quality and value for your lifestyle.</p>
